# Py3MVC
Needed a working example of MVC in Python 3.

Run TestController.py to see a small dialog window that converts feet to meters.
You can either hit the Enter key or click on the Calculate button to get a result.

Mostly put this together to get more familiar with tkinter and Python 3.

Enjoy!
